\title{Check User Genotypes for Common Disease-Associated SNPs}
\usage{
check_disease_snps(user_data, disease_ref = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{user_data}{A data frame or tibble containing user SNP data, MUST include
columns 'rsid', 'chromosome', 'position', and 'genotype'. Typically the
output of \code{read_user_data()}.}

\item{disease_ref}{A data frame or tibble containing the reference disease
SNP information, typically from \code{read_disease_snp_reference()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarizing the user's genotype for the found disease SNPs,
including risk allele count, or an empty tibble if no matches or errors occur.
}
\description{
Merges user's SNP data with a reference list of disease-associated SNPs
and reports the user's genotype at those locations.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming user_snps_df is loaded from read_user_data()
  # and includes the rsid column
  disease_results <- check_disease_snps(user_snps_df)
  print(disease_results)
}
}
