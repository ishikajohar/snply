\title{Read Reference Data (Neanderthal SNP list)}
\usage{
read_reference_data()
}
\value{
A tibble of reference SNP data with an added \code{archaic_allele} column.
}
\description{
Reads the reference CSV file containing archaic SNP information.
It detects which allele is marked with an asterisk (indicating the Neanderthal-derived allele),
strips the asterisk, and stores that allele in a new column \code{archaic_allele}.
}
\details{
The function attempts to find the CSV in the installed package's \code{extdata} directory,
and falls back to a relative path if not found.
}
